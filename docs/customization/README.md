# How to Customize ProjectHuddle

ProjectHuddle contains a multitude of ways to customize functionality, styling, html output and even ways to
extend your own functionality.

ProjectHuddle contains php and javascript hooks and a template extension system with the intent to ensure
you not modify the plugin directly. Modifying the plugin files will result in a complete loss of your changes should
you ever decide to update in the future.
