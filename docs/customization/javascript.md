[BackboneJS](https://backbonejs.org/)

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

[WordPress REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/)

## Global ph.api Object
ProjectHuddle sets up a global ph.api object to store all it's functions, methods and data. Almost everything
you need to extend ProjectHuddle is located in this object.
